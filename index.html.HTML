	<P>  Queen's Scribe, LLC is dedicated to helping small business and start-ups get their feet off the ground. 
		With a new business, it’s easy to get bogged down “in the weeds” with everything that needs to be set up to run efficiently.

<br>
We know the frustration of feeling like you’re not in control of the 
services you outsource. You need to outsource these services because you don’t have the manpower or 
resources to do it yourself, YET. 
<br>
<br>
Our goal is to get you to there, but on <strong>your terms</strong>. 
<br>
<br>
All the services provided by Queens Scribe come with no contract and complete transparency. 
Upon our first meeting, we will make a list of what services can benefit you and send you a proposal 
for these services. This proposal is like an a-la-carte menu, you get to choose what you’d like us to 
help you with, it’s not a packaged deal. When hired, 
we will go through your needs more thoroughly and give you a list of what we need to get started.

  Queens Scribe can provide these services and more with no contract, 
and with no “packaged deals”, meaning the small businesses that hire Queens Scribe
get to choose the services they want to outsource - without feeling trapped.
Most importantly, Queens Scribe will set everything up the way the business wants them, 
working closely with 
owners and management to deliver services and processes that suit their needs specifically.
